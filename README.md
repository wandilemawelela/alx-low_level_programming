# alx-low_level_programming
This repository contains low-level programming tasks completed during my Software Engineering programme at ALX - Holberton. You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives. You will not be able to meet the objectives by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
